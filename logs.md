## 2026-05-15

**Summary:** Fixed gdown `fuzzy` API breakage for Google Drive downloads and prevented concurrent yt-dlp update crashes.

**Done:**
- `ytdlp_skill.py:337` — Removed `fuzzy=True` from `_gdown.download()` call (gdown 6.x dropped the parameter)
- `app.py:96` — Added `self._updating = False` guard flag to prevent concurrent pip update runs
- `app.py:333` — `_update_ytdlp()`: gate on `_updating` flag, added WinError 32 detection with clear actionable error message, added `finally` block to always reset the flag
- Ran yt-dlp nightly update from terminal — confirmed already at `2026.5.5.233942` (latest)

**Decisions:**
- Removed `fuzzy=True` without replacement — gdown 6.x handles URL normalization internally, no substitute parameter needed
- WinError 32 (file locked by running process) is surfaced as a human-readable message rather than a raw pip traceback

**Errors/Fixes:**
- `gdown error: download() got an unexpected keyword argument 'fuzzy'` — caused by gdown 6.0 API change; fixed by removing the argument
- `ERROR: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file` — caused by double-clicking Update button, spawning two concurrent pip processes; fixed with guard flag

**Left to do / Follow-up:**
- Google Drive 403 errors on yt-dlp fallback — those files are private/restricted; would need Google auth (cookies or service account) to download them

## 2026-05-07

**Summary:** Fixed YouTube Shorts download failure, added Google Drive support, Thai filename fix, and major watcher/skill robustness overhaul.

**Done:**
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Fixed YouTube Shorts "not available" error by adding `extractor_args: youtube:player_client=ios,web` to both API and subprocess paths
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Added Google Drive download support via `gdown` library with yt-dlp fallback; added `_gdrive_file_id()`, `_download_gdrive()`, `_GDRIVE_RE` regex
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Fixed Thai/Unicode filenames being stripped: changed `restrictfilenames=True` → `False` (kept `windowsfilenames=True`)
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Added `playlist: bool = False` param to `download()`, `_download_api()`, `_download_subprocess()`, `Downloader.download()`; playlist-aware output template
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Added `write_metadata: bool = True` param; enables `writeinfojson`/`--write-info-json` for `.info.json` sidecar per download
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Fixed `load_history()` corruption: bad JSON now backs up to `.bak.json` and warns instead of silently resetting
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Added public helpers: `check_disk_space()`, `has_partial_files()`, `check_dependencies()`
- `watcher.py` — Replaced sequential download loop with `ThreadPoolExecutor` (default 3 workers, `--max-workers` flag)
- `watcher.py` — Reused single Chromium instance via `Downloader` context manager (was launching a new browser per URL)
- `watcher.py` — Added dependency check at startup (`check_dependencies()`) for yt-dlp and ffmpeg
- `watcher.py` — Added disk space warning (<1 GB free) before each queued download
- `watcher.py` — Added partial download detection: scans for `.part` files after each "successful" future; keeps URL out of history if found
- `watcher.py` — Added `--playlist` and `--max-workers` CLI flags; removed unused `--browser` flag
- Committed and pushed to GitHub (`dd24e36` on `master`)

**Decisions:**
- Used `ios` player client for YouTube (not `web`) because it doesn't require a JS runtime/Deno and works natively with Shorts
- Used `gdown` for Google Drive (not raw `requests`) because it handles the virus-scan bypass for large files
- Kept `watchdog` library out — polling at 1s is sufficient for a local file; the dependency isn't worth it
- Skipped quality/resolution selector and desktop notifications (user explicitly excluded items 4 and 6)
- `write_metadata=True` by default so all downloads get `.info.json` sidecars automatically

**Errors/Fixes:**
- YouTube Shorts `ERROR: This video is not available` — caused by fallback to `android_vr` client when no JS runtime found; fixed with `extractor_args ios,web`
- Thai characters in filenames replaced with `_` — caused by `restrictfilenames=True` (ASCII-only); fixed by setting to `False`

**Left to do / Follow-up:**
- Quality/resolution selector (480p / 720p / 1080p / 4K) — skipped this session
- Desktop notification on finish/fail (Windows toast) — skipped this session
- `app.py` not updated to match new `download()` signature (`playlist`, `write_metadata` params)

## 2026-05-13

**Summary:** Fixed YouTube download failures caused by new PO-token / JS-challenge anti-bot wall; switched to nightly yt-dlp and PO-token-free player clients; restored Thai filenames in `app.py`.

**Done:**
- `ytdlp_skill.py` + `app.py` — Replaced YouTube `player_client` from `mweb,web` → `tv_simply,android_vr,tv,web` (no PO token, avoids tv DRM experiment)
- `ytdlp_skill.py` + `app.py` — Added `--remote-components ejs:github` / `remote_components: ["ejs:github"]` so yt-dlp auto-fetches the JS challenge solver
- `app.py:334 _update_ytdlp()` — Rewrote update button to use nightly channel (`yt-dlp-nightly-builds` tarball), uses `sys.executable -m pip`, shows before→after version
- `app.py` — Set `restrictfilenames: False` and removed `--restrict-filenames` so Thai/Unicode characters are preserved in filenames (kept `windows-filenames`)
- Installed yt-dlp nightly `2026.5.5.233942` locally (replaced 2-month-old PyPI stable `2026.3.17`)

**Decisions:**
- Use nightly yt-dlp by default — PyPI stable lags YouTube extractor fixes by weeks; the user hit a 2-month-old release while YouTube had rolled out PO tokens
- Picked `tv_simply` + `android_vr` as primary clients — currently the only two that need neither PO token nor JS challenge solving
- Kept `web` as last fallback (works once `ejs:github` auto-fetches the JS solver) instead of recommending manual deno install up front
- Did NOT refactor the duplicated yt-dlp logic in `app.py` (mirrors `ytdlp_skill.py`) — flagged as cleanup but out of scope

**Errors/Fixes:**
- `mweb` PO-token error + JS challenge failure → switched clients away from mweb/ios
- `tv` client DRM-protected via session experiment → added `tv_simply` (different code path) and `android_vr` ahead of it
- After first edit, error persisted → discovered `app.py` has its own duplicated `extractor_args` (lines 609, 662) overriding the skill module
- After update, still old version → root cause: yt-dlp PyPI stable is too old; switched to nightly tarball install
- Thai title stripped from filename → `restrictfilenames=True` was forcing ASCII-only

**Left to do / Follow-up:**
- ~~Refactor `app.py` to call `ytdlp_skill.download()` instead of maintaining a duplicate yt-dlp pipeline~~ ✓ done same session (commit `8f866e8`)
- If `tv_simply`/`android_vr` get blocked later, document the deno install path (`winget install denoland.deno`) for the `web` client JS fallback
- Update `_update_ytdlp` could optionally check GitHub releases API to surface "new nightly available" without forcing reinstall

## 2026-05-13 (session 2)

**Summary:** Refactored `app.py` to route through `ytdlp_skill.Downloader` instead of maintaining a duplicate yt-dlp pipeline.

**Done:**
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — Added `browser_cookie`, `progress_hook`, `pre_resolved`, and overridable `log` params to module-level `download()` and `Downloader.download()`
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — `_download_api` now accepts `browser_cookie` (wires `cookiesfrombrowser`) and appends caller's `progress_hook` to the internal milestone hook
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — `_download_subprocess` now accepts `browser_cookie` (wires `--cookies-from-browser`)
- `ytdlp_skill.py` — `download()` skips `resolve_url()` when `pre_resolved=True`
- `app.py` — Removed `_download_via_api` (~110 lines) and `_download_via_subprocess` (~70 lines); `_download_one` now calls `self._downloader.download(...)` and keeps retry/permanent-error wrapper
- `app.py` — GUI status-bar live updates moved into a small `progress_hook` closure passed into the skill
- Commit `8f866e8` — net `-149` lines (app.py -200, ytdlp_skill.py +30)

**Decisions:**
- Added `pre_resolved` flag rather than re-resolving in the skill — app's Phase 1 already resolves all URLs sequentially while keeping the shared Playwright browser warm; re-resolving Brightcove/F1 player URLs would waste a browser launch
- Kept `extra_progress_hook` (the skill's internal name) separate from the milestone-logging hook so callers add behavior without losing the default progress log
- `write_metadata=False` in app's call to preserve current behavior (no `.info.json` sidecars) — skill default is True
- Left `_yt_dlp` import and `YT_DLP_API_OK` flag in app.py — still used for header version display and startup log message only, not for download path

**Errors/Fixes:** none — clean refactor, behavior preserved

**Left to do / Follow-up:**
- If `tv_simply`/`android_vr` get blocked later, document deno install for `web` client JS fallback
- Quality/resolution selector (480p / 720p / 1080p / 4K) — still skipped
- Desktop notification on finish/fail — still skipped
- Consider exposing `write_metadata` as a UI checkbox so users can opt into `.info.json` sidecars
